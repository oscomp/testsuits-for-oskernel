Introduction:
-------------

The module hwlat is a special purpose kernel module that is
used to detect if System Management Interrupts (SMIs) are causing event
latencies in the Linux RT kernel.

SMIs are usually not serviced by the Linux kernel. They are set up by
BIOS code and are serviced by BIOS code, usually for critical events
such as management of thermal sensors and fans. Sometimes though, SMIs
are used for other tasks and those tasks can spend an inordinate
amount of time in the handler (sometimes measured in milliseconds).
Obviously if you are trying to keep event service latencies down in the
microsecond range, this is a problem.

The SMI detector works by hogging the cpu for configurable amounts of
time (by calling stop_machine()), polling the Time Stamp Counter (TSC)
register for some period, then looking for gaps in the TSC data. Any
gap indicates a time when the polling was interrupted and since the
machine is stopped and interrupts turned off the only thing that could
do that would be an SMI.

Note that the SMI detector should *NEVER* be used in a production
environment. It is intended to be run manually to determine if the
hardware platform has a problem with long SMI service routines.

Usage:
------

Loading the module hwlat passing the parameter "enabled=1" is the only
step required to start the hwlat. It is possible to define a threshold
in microseconds (us) above which latency spikes will be taken in account
(parameter "threshold=").

Example:

	# insmod ./hwlat.ko enabled=1 threshold=100

After the module is loaded, it creates a directory named "hwlat" under
the debugfs mountpoint, "/debugfs/hwlat" for this text. It is necessary
to have debugfs mounted.

avg_smi_interval_us	- average interval (usecs) between SMI latency spikes
latency_threshold_us	- minimum latency value to be considered (usecs)
max_sample_us		- maximum SMI latency spike observed (usecs)
ms_between_samples	- interval between samples (ms)
ms_per_sample		- sampling time (ms)
sample_us		- last sample (usecs). continuously updated, may be used
			  to plot graphs or to create histograms
smi_count		- how many latency spikes have been observed


	# cd /debugfs/hwlat

	# cat *
	0		(avg_smi_interval_us)
	100		(latency_threshold_us)
	0		(latency_threshold_us)
	5000		(ms_between_samples)
	1		(ms_per_sample)
	3		(sample_us)
	0		(smi_count)


The default values for ms_between_samples and ms_per_sample define that every
5000ms (5s) samples will be collected during 1ms. It is possible to change the
sampling time or the sampling interval writing to the related files. To collect
samples during 5ms every 50ms:

	# echo 5 > ms_per_sample
	# echo 50 > ms_between_samples


	# cat ms_between_samples
	50
	# cat ms_per_sample
	5

After a while, data may be verified to test the existence of SMI induced
latencies:

	# cat smi_count
	2
	# cat max_sample_us
	468
	# cat avg_smi_interval_us
	1356306050

Depending on the latencies observed it is important to better adjust the
sampling intervals to obtain more accurate measurements. Care must be taken
to not create a continuous sampling situation, that might be perceived by the
kernel as a deadlock.

Python Script
-------------

A python script is provided in in the kernel scripts directory named
'hwlatdetect'. This script handles mounting/unmounting the debugfs,
loading/unloading the hwlat module, setting various parameters
for the SMI detector and then starting and stopping the detection. The
hwlatdetect script handles the following arguments:

Usage: hwlatdetect [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --duration=DURATION   total time to test for SMIs (<n>{smdw})
  --threshold=THRESHOLD
                        value above which is considered an SMI (microseconds
  --interval=INTERVAL   time between samples (milliseconds)
  --sample_width=SAMPLE_WIDTH
                        time to actually measure (milliseconds)
  --report=REPORT       filename for sample data
  --cleanup             force unload of module and umount of debugfs
  --debug               turn on debugging prints
  --quiet               turn off all screen output
  --watch               print sample data to stdout as it arrives


An example run looks like this:

   $ sudo hwlatdetect --duration=1m --report=smi.txt
   hwlatdetect:  test duration 60 seconds
      parameters:
              Latency threshold: 100us
	      Non-sampling gap:  5ms
	      Sample length:     20ms
              Output File:       smi.txt
   Starting test
   test finished
   Max Latency: 427us
   Samples recorded: 2201
   Samples exceeding threshold: 7
   sample data written to smi.txt
   $

The above run generated 2201 samples of which 27 exceeded the 100
microsecond threshold.
